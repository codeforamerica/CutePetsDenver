You need to sign up for a twitter API. You'll need all of the following:
* consumer key

If you're using a Mac or Linux, you can do this in bash by running these commands:

`export consumer_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX `

###ABOUT
A twitter bot that pulls data from [Adopt-A-Pet-Denver](https://github.com/dviramontes/Adopt-a-Pet-Denver) an API created by [David Viramontes](https://github.com/dviramontes/) and me to serve data for animals currently in Denver animal shelters ready for adoption.
